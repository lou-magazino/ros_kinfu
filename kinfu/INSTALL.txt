== INSTALLATION ==

Since PCL does not support KinFu anymore, the source code of KinFu was just copy-pasted into the pcl_kinfu_large_scale folder.
This node now compiles like a common ROS node, except that:
  - You need a working CUDA installation and a CUDA-capable NVidia video card
  - To enable the package, you have to rename cmake/KinfuTrigger.cmake.readme into KinfuTrigger.cmake
